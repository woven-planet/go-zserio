/*
zserio is a serialization framework designed for environments where
storage or bandwidth is the most critical constraint. The primary use
case is the NDS.Live format for automobile map data.

This package implements the de(serialization) of the core zserio data
types, as well as a code generator to create Go code from zserio
schema definitions.

Installation

You can use the normal go install method to install go-zserio:

   go install github.com/woven-planet/go-zserio/zserio@latest

Code generation

The most common, and strongly preferred, method to use zserio is to write
a zserio schema, and then generate code to define the data structures and
serialization code.

As an example let's look at a zserio schema for a contact list. In a minimal
example we only define an Addreses structure to store addres information.

    package contacts;

    // Address, so I know where your house lives
    struct Address
    {
        string street;
        optional uint8 number;
    };

After saving this in schema/contacts.zs you can generate Go code for this
schema with this command:

  zserio generate --out contacts -r myprojects.home/zserio-example/addressbook ./schema

This will create a number of code files in the "contacts" directory. The root
package is set to "myprojects.home/zserio-example/addressbook", and must be
defined to import statements can be generated.

Can you now import the generated code, and serialize Address records using zserio:

    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "os"

        "github.com/icza/bitio"
        "myprojects.home/zserio-example/contacts"
    )

    func main() {
        address := contacts.Address{Street: "Mainstreet"}
        writer := bitio.NewCountWriter(os.Stdout)
        if err := address.MarshalZserio(writer); err != nil {
            panic(fmt.Sprintf("error serializing address: %v", err))
        }
        if err := writer.Close(); err != nil {
            panic(fmt.Sprintf("error closing writer: %v", err))
        }
   }
